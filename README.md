# skeleton

A functional programming framework wrapper around AngularJS v2.0, NodeJS, and MySQL to facilitate rapid setup and development of web applications via automatic adaptation to additional assets to the project.
Developed with the functional programming paradigm, including currying and pointless style to minimize boilerplate and increase abstraction and inversion of control.

(Multithreading and MySQL not included yet)
